# nChain / Teranode Group

At nChain I have focused mainly on zkSNARKs and their implementations.
The first project I worked on was the implementation in Bitcoin Script of the Groth16 verifier, while the second focused on enforcing constraints on Bitcoin transactions using zero-knowledge proofs, so to ensure privacy and enhance programmability.

The project led to two papers:

<b>Enforcing arbitrary constraints on Bitcoin transactions</b>, with Enrique Larraia, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/912">ePrint:2025:192</a>.

<b>Practical Implementation of Pairing-Based zkSNARK in Bitcoin Script</b>, with Enrique Larraia, Paul Germouty, Wei Zhang, published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9783031823480">Computer Security. ESORICS 2024 International Workshops</a> (as part of the proceedings of <i>8th International Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology</i>), <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1498">ePrint:2024/1498</a>.

The code supporting the papers (and more) is available in the GitHub repositories [zkscript](https://github.com/nchain-innovation/zkscript_package) and [bitcoin_r1cs](https://github.com/nchain-innovation/bitcoin_r1cs).

# PhD

During my PhD, I studied geometric problems through the lenses of homological algebra.
In other words, I studied the shape of geometric objects (locally) defined by polynomial equations

$$f_i(z_1, \dots, z_n) = 0$$

by looking at various algebraic gadgets attached to them (the focus mainly being on the derived category $D^b(X)$). My PhD thesis can be found here:
