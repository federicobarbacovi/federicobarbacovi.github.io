# nChain

At nChain I have focused mainly on zkSNARKs and their implementations.
The first project I worked on was the implementation in Bitcoin Script of the Groth16 verifier.
The results appeared in the following paper:

<b>Practical Implementation of Pairing-Based zkSNARK in Bitcoin Script</b>, with Enrique Larraia, Paul Germouty, Wei Zhang, published in the <i>8th International Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology</i>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1498">ePrint:2024/1498</a>.

</ol>

The code supporting the paper (and more) is available in the GitHub repository [zkscript](https://github.com/nchain-innovation/zkscript_package).

# PhD

During my PhD, I studied geometric problems through the lenses of homological algebra.
In other words, I studied the shape of geometric objects (locally) defined by polynomial equations

$$f_i(z_1, \dots, z_n) = 0$$

by looking at various algebraic gadgets attached to them (the focus mainly being on the derived category $D^b(X)$). My PhD thesis can be found here:
